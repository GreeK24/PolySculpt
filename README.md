# PolySculpt

PolySculpt is a Virtual Reality Sculpting Application for Beginners. It's developed using Unity3D and HTC Vive. It uses basic sculpting tools such as sculpt, symmetry, smooth, and paint. It also has a grab, scale, rotate, and crease feature. It includes a 3D model exporter for 3D printing. Lastly, it uses a simple goal-based learning system to teach the users new tools and features.
